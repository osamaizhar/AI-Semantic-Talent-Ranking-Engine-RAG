# Talent Matching and Ranking System (Potential Talents)
### **H8ZdgkjygVUSOdtd**
## Project Background

This project was done for a talent sourcing and management company, that faces challenges in finding talented individuals for technology companies. The process requires understanding client needs, identifying candidate qualifications, and knowing where to find suitable talent. This labor-intensive process involves many manual operations.

My goal was to develop a machine learning-powered pipeline that can automatically identify and rank candidates based on their fitness for specific roles. The system should improve its rankings through feedback when reviewers "star" candidates that are ideal matches.



## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my AI Residency at Apziva for a talent sourcing client. I implemented an advanced semantic matching system for job titles using various NLP techniques in the `NLP_OPS.ipynb` notebook. The solution:

1. Processes candidate data from two datasets:
   - `potential-talents.xlsx` for the initial workflow and testing
   - `et_data.xlsx` for model fine-tuning
2. Matches candidates to job search terms using multiple semantic similarity methods
3. Implements a fine-tuned embedding model for improved matching
4. Provides re-ranking capabilities based on user feedback
5. Integrates with Pinecone for upsertion and querying of data
6. Uses a Finetuned LLM for candidate ranking and filtering


## Data Processing

The workflow uses two key datasets:
- **et_data.xlsx**: Used for training and fine-tuning the custom embedding model
- **potential-talents.xlsx**: Used for the initial workflow, testing, and demonstration

## Features

- **Multiple Similarity Methods**: Implements and compares TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, SBERT, and custom fine-tuned models
- **Semantic Matching**: Uses advanced NLP metrics (BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr) for job title matching
- **Fine-tuned Embedding Model**: Custom-trained model based on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with LoRA fine-tuning
- **Interactive Re-ranking**: Allows users to "star" candidates to improve future rankings
- **Pinecone Upsertion Pipeline RAG**: Upserts data to pinecone For RAG , refer to `upsert_pinecone_pipeline.ipynb`
- **Pinecone Querying RAG**: Query Pinecone Data via cosine similarity and give user appropriate ranked candidates via Finetuned LLM refer to `pinecone_query_pipeline.ipynb`

## Technical Implementation

### NLP Models and Techniques

The system employs multiple embedding techniques:
- **TF-IDF**: Basic keyword matching baseline
- **Word2Vec**: Pre-trained word embeddings from Google News
- **GloVe**: Global word representations
- **FastText**: Subword-aware embeddings
- **SBERT**: Sentence-level embeddings
- **Fine-tuned SBERT**: Custom model trained on job title pairs from et_data.xlsx

### Fine-tuning Process

I implemented a comprehensive fine-tuning pipeline in `NLP_OPS.ipynb`:
1. Created training pairs from job titles in et_data.xlsx
2. Used METEOR scores as similarity targets for these pairs
3. Applied LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning to the base SBERT model
4. Saved the fine-tuned model to "finetuned_job_title_model/" directory
5. Evaluated performance against baseline models using potential-talents.xlsx

The fine-tuning process specifically targets the transformer attention layers (query, key, value, and output dense layers) to optimize for job title matching while keeping the parameter count low.

### LLM Integration

I also implemented an LLM-based ranking system using the Groq API (with Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model) to provide an alternative ranking method that leverages large language models for semantic understanding.

## Results and Conclusions

### Model Performance

After extensive testing with the potential-talents.xlsx dataset, I found:

1. **TF-IDF baseline** achieved an average similarity score of 0.42
2. **Word2Vec** improved to 0.51 (+0.09)
3. **GloVe** reached 0.53 (+0.11)
4. **FastText** achieved 0.55 (+0.13)
5. **SBERT** reached 0.61 (+0.19)
6. **SBERT + LoRA Fine-Tuning** achieved the best performance at 0.68 (+0.26)

This represents a 62% improvement from the baseline TF-IDF approach to our fine-tuned model.

### Comparison of Methods

| Method | Advantages | Limitations |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| TF-IDF | Simple, fast | Misses semantic relationships |
| Word2Vec/GloVe | Good semantic understanding | Word-level only, misses context |
| SBERT | Excellent semantic matching | Computationally intensive |
| Fine-tuned SBERT | Best domain-specific matching | Requires training data |
| METEOR | Best for short text comparison | Slower than vector-based methods |

## Recommendations

Based on my findings, I recommend:

1. **Use the fine-tuned SBERT model** for initial candidate ranking
2. **Implement METEOR scoring** as a secondary ranking method for edge cases
3. **Establish a dynamic cutoff threshold** based on the distribution of similarity scores (recommended at 0.6 similarity score)
4. **Implement an active learning approach** where user feedback continuously improves the model
5. **Consider adding more candidate features** beyond job titles for more robust matching


## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (Groq API for LLM integration)
4. Run your desired notebook

### Usage

1. Load candidate data from Excel files (et_data.xlsx and potential-talents.xlsx)
2. Specify search terms for the roles you're trying to fill
3. Run the ranking algorithm to get sorted candidates
4. Star candidates to improve future rankings

## Conclusion

This project, completed during my **AI Residency at Apziva**, successfully demonstrates how **NLP techniques** can **automate** and improve the **talent matching process**. The **fine-tuned model** provides significant advantages over **keyword matching**, and the **feedback mechanism** ensures **continuous improvement**. 

By implementing this system, talent sourcing teams can:
- Save significant time in **candidate screening**
- Reduce **unconscious bias** in the selection process
- Find better **matches** for their clients' specific needs
- **Continuously improve** through an **active learning** approach
